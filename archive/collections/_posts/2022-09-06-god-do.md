It pays to realize, especially in our 20s, that we don’t know [anything](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6xeYb4Q2aU). Too much to learn, too little time.

Any idea that the 21-year-old brain has, is suspect. The prefrontal cortex does not mature until age 25.

Let other people, those old and wise, make decisions for us. The ideal would be “God,” he is quite old and (presumably) pretty smart. When choosing an action or lack thereof, replace “What should I do?” with “What would God want me to do?”

Most people don’t “know” God very well, making him difficult to imitate. It’s better to use real people as proxies for that ideal.  Create an imaginary board of advisors, who represent your ideals.

This should happen as you read and learn to admire great thinkers. My list would look something like:

- Naval Ravikant
- Charlie Munger / Peter Kaufman
- Peter Thiel
- Balaji Srinivasan
- Elon Musk / Jeff Bezos
- Michael Singer
- Kapil Gupta
- Ben Franklin
- Jesus / Buddha
- Scott Adams
- David Deutsch

Formalizing this process will make knowledge from reading more accessible. “What should I do?” is an unbounded question whose default answer is fear or apathy. “What would Ben Franklin do in this situation?” has a clear answer.
